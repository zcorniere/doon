# Purpose
Having fun, really. In more pratical term, the goal of this projet is to make something like the doom-engine.

# Dependencies
- compile using clang++, link using lld, so they are required
  - but you can use `g++` and `ld`, but you need to edit the Makefile
- SFML, for window management, textures, etc...

## Building
```bash
make
```
